I want to write a solidity code in which the user will store their data by calling the function called listData and this will create an array of senders and the mapping will be created from sender address to Data struct. Whenever any buyer wants to purchase the data of the sellers, they can pay usdc accordingly and then we are supposed to create an array of Data. In order to create this array, we are supposed to iterate through the sender's array and check the data of each sender from the earlier mapping that we created and put all the data to this newly created array and hence return all the data to the buyer.
